# Virtual-Pet

## Description
We all remember when Tamagotchi was all the rage right? Much like our friends of the past this site will allow its users to create their own pet and interact with
it. I created this application as a means of practicing some of the basic principles of Object Oriented Programming to include inheritance from supertypes and
constructing prototypes in a single object to keep code dry. For the sake of time, this application will be kept at a very simplistic level, just enough to ensure that it is functioning as desired. 

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS/Bootstrap
* Vanilla JavaScript

## Future Development
In the future when I am allowed more time to fully polish this application, I would like to include more CSS animations in order to make the user interface more
interactive and engaging. Each time the user interacts with their pet, I would like to dynamically change the image and text that is displayed so there is a visual cue indicating what the pet is doing, or what they might require after a certain task has been completed. Additionally, I would like to store each pet in the local storage so if the user returns they can pick up right where they left off without having to create a new pet with each visit. Finally, I would also like to include
a greater selection of pets and expand the methods on the prototype so that there is a wider variety of interactions to take part in.
